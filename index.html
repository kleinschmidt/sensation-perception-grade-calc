                The final exam will have two parts.  The first part will have 30
                questions and cover material since the second midterm (classes
                19-24).  The second part will have 60 questions and is
                cumulative.  That means there are <strong>four</strong> assessments
                from this class: the two midterms, the non-cumulative portion of
                the final, and the cumulative portion.  Your lowest score of the
                four will be dropped (using the percentage correct to determine
                which is lowest).
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that <strong>you can skip one part of the final</strong>
                without penalty.  If you don't take one part of the final, a
                grade of zero will be entered which will be dropped from your
                final grade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the four assessments have different numbers of
                questions, they have different weights in the calculation of the
                final grade.  This might be confusing so I've created a small
                calculator to help you see what would happen with different
                scores on the final.

            <h2>How to use the calculator</h2>
            <p>
                Enter your scores on the first two midterms, and adjust the
                anticipated scores for the two parts of the final
                (non-cumulative covers classes 19-24; cumulative covers entire
                semester).
            </p>
            <p>
                For all exams, put in the number of questions correct (the score
                listed on Canvas, not the percentage.
            <p>
                Put a 0 in to simulate skipping one part of the final, or leave
                it blank
